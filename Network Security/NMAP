NMAP - Port scanning, network discovery

-vv for verbosity
-Pn treats hosts as UP
-A complete scan
-s stealth scan (never establishes connection just sends a reset packet to prevent an IDS/Firewall from alarming though most ngfw WILL pick up on it)
-S Syn scan
-T for speed 1 slowest, more complete probably will find more ports 5 fastest, 4 should be okay in lab - 5 is not recommended
-p- Full range of ports if you don't put - after -p it will scan only standard well known ports
-oA save all to xml file, -oN gives you nmap file; /path/to/file

    nmap -vv -Pn -A -sS -T4 -p- -oA/N /winnie/Desktop/tcpscan.txt 192.168.2.2
