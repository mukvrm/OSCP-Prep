##Goal: Ping Sweep a range##

#ping on a count (-c) of 1; Grep = show only quoted string; 
#cutting a delimiter (-d) specified in " " - in this case space; 
#the field specifies the word (in this case the IP address so the 
#flag yields a curated list of responding IP addresses which is 
#what we want) of 4. But a range can be specified if 4-9 format is 
#used; sed is used to remove characters from final output 's/.$//' 
# ***Research pending on the syntax of "sed" linux command *** 

    ping -c 1 192.168.1.1 | grep "64 bytes from" | cut -d " " -f 4 | sed 's/.$//'

#For loop - don't forget to add "; done" at the end so we don't run into '>' prompt issue
#below for loop: pings 1-255 hosts in 192.168.1.0/24; grep prints the matching lines "64 bytes from"; cut - remove sections from each #line of files usign "-d". --delimiter=DELIM - use delimiter instead of TAB for field delimiter. (in this case a space " ")
#finally sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text helps us (more research needed on 's/.$//')

    for i in {1..255}; do ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "64 bytes from" | cut -d " " -f 4 | sed 's/.$//'; done

#save test results to a file 

    ping -c 1 192.168.1.1 > ping.txt 

#The number of settings is 4 and the interval is 3 seconds:

    ping -c 4 -i 3 www.google.com

#Use the ping command to obtain the IP address of the specified website:

    ping -c 1 google.com | grep from | cut -d " " -f 4
