#Differences of TCP vs UDP


    #TCP:
    Connection-oriented
    Reliable transmission - HTTP/FTP/SSH
    How? - 3 way handshake

    #UDP
    Connectionless
    Fast connection > reliability (DNS, DHCP, SNMP)
    No handshake 
    Hard to scan (false positives, false negative; machine not showing open UDP port but it might be open 
    
)
